						<h2>Camping</h2>
						<p>The camp consists of nine guest tents each with accommodation for two people. Each tent has its own toilet and shower, so you can enjoy the luxury of en-suite living 'safaris style', with hot water heated over a log fire and brought to your shower when you're ready.<br><br>

						The meals at Nairobi Tented Camp are crafted to complement the authenticity of the safari experience. All meals are served on a set menu basis, with warming hearty breakfast in the morning, light invigorating lunches served under the shade of an olive tree and dinners of soufflés and tender beef fillet served under the star filled sky. Everything at Nairobi Tented Camp is homemade and cooked with special care and attention. If you have any special dietary requirements please let us know at the time of booking. Ice cold drinks are available from the fully stocked bar in the central mess tent.<br><br>

						Low watt LED lighting in each of the tents runs off rechargeable batteries and solar panels, and for dining, guests can enjoy the romance of candles and lanterns - a truly authentic tented camp experience.</p>

						<h2>Activities</h2>
						<p>Your day in Nairobi Tented Camp starts with a freshly brewed hot drink brought to your tent before setting off for that famous safari tradition – an early morning game drive.  Be lucky enough to catch the first rays of early morning sun as they burn off the night dust of dew stirring the plains game gently to life.<br><br>

						After a morning potentially filled with sightings of lion, buffalo and leopard, return to camp for more warming cups of tea and coffee, freshly baked bread and a hearty cooked breakfast.  The camp is made up of nine guest tents and a central mess and dining tent from which meals will be served.  In the afternoon, guests can relax in the lounge area or in the privacy of their own tent.  There is nothing more blissful than sleeping off your three course lunch in a swaying hammock under the shade of an olive tree.<br><br>

						As the day cools and the sun starts its journey west, it will be time for another game drive – a chance to catch that evasive moment where a lion might decide it is time to feast.  Return to camp for drinks and exchange stories around the campfire before dinner under the vast African star-lit sky, ultimately retreating to the comfort of your bed in your cozy tent.</p>
